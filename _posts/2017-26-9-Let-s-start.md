I am great at ranting and commenting random on sites. I might as well do it a blog, providing TL:DRs about items I know, linking few nice things and trying to spread some contagious laughter.

Mostly spreading some laughter. It's important. I heard people pay a lot of money to laugh at some events. They can just come to me; I'll laugh for free!
